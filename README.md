# Sqlite

This is a fork of [github.com/go-gorm/sqlite](github.com/go-gorm/sqlite)

That works with [modernc.org/sqlite](modernc.org/sqlite) which is a pure-go sqlite
implementation. Obviously, because `modernc.org/sqlite` is a re-implementation of sqlite 
there might be missing features and stability issues. It should work for development or simple use-cases.
